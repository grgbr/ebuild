Overview
========

This guide mainly focuses upon how to build and deploy software projects which
build system is based upon |eBuild|.
This document mainly targets software package integration.

|eBuild| is distributed under the :ref:`GNU General Public License <gpl>`.

.. _sect-user-prerequisites:

Prerequisites
=============

.. rubric:: Minimal requirements

The following installed package is required to build |eBuild| based packages :

* |GNU make|.
 
.. rubric:: Documentation generation

In addition, you might need the following installed packages to build the
documentation :

* |Doxygen|,
* |Kconfiglib|,
* |LaTeX|,
* |Latexmk|,
* |Python| version 3,
* |Sphinx|,
* |Sphinx Read The Docs theme|,
* |Texinfo|,
* |Rsync|.

.. rubric:: Full-feature requirements

For a full-featured |eBuild| based package, the following is also required in
addition to the above :

* |KConfig|,
* |Pkg-config|,
* a compile and link toolchain such as |GNU Binutils| and |GNU GCC|,
* |Ctags| and / or |Cscope| source tag database tools,
* |XZ| compression tools.
 
.. _sect-user-workflow:

Workflow
========

The typical build and install workflow for a software project based upon
|eBuild| is the following:

#. Configure_ the construction logic
#. |Build| programs, libraries and other objects required at running time,
#. |Install| components, copying files previously built to system-wide
   directories

The 3 phases mentioned above are subject to customization thanks to multiple
:command:`make` variable settings that may be passed on the command line.  You
are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific needs. Most of the
time, setting BUILDDIR_, PREFIX_ and CROSS_COMPILE_ is sufficient. Refer to the
following sections for further informations.

After a successful |Install| phase, final constructed objects are located under
the directory pointed to by ``$(DESTDIR)$(PREFIX)`` where DESTDIR_ and PREFIX_
are 2 :command:`make` variables the user may specify on the command line to
customize the final install location.

Alternatively, you are also provided with the ability to :

* cleanup_ generated objects,
* generate documentation_,
* generate `source tags`_,
* generate source distribution_ tarball.

To begin with, configure_ the build process according to the following section.

.. _sect-user-configure:

Configure
---------

To apply the project's **default build configuration**, run the following
command from the top-level project's source tree:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make defconfig

You may specify an alternate default build configuration file by giving
:command:`make` a |DEFCONFIG| variable which value points to an arbitrary file
path:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make defconfig DEFCONFIG=$HOME/build/config/project.defconfig

This alternate default build configuration file may be generated from current
configuration into the :file:`defconfig` file located under directory pointed to
by the BUILDDIR_ variable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make saveconfig BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project
     KSAVE   /home/worker/build/project/defconfig

Optionally, you may **tweak build options** interactively:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make menuconfig BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

The :ref:`menuconfig target <target-menuconfig>` runs a menu-driven
user interface allowing you to configure build options. You may run alternate
user interfaces using the following :command:`make` targets :

* xconfig_ for a QT menu-driven interface,
* and gconfig_ for GTK menu-driven interface.

The default build directory location is overwritten by giving :command:`make`
the BUILDDIR_ variable which value points to an arbitrary pathname. Intermediate
objects are built under the passed directory to prevent from polluting the
project's source tree as in the following example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make defconfig BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project
   
You may refine the configuration logic by giving :command:`make` additional
variables.  *You are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific
needs*. Section Variables_ describes the following variables which are available
for configuration customization purpose:

* EBUILDDIR_,
* |DEFCONFIG|,
* BUILDDIR_,
* KCONF_, KGCONF_, KMCONF_, KXCONF_,
* in addition to variables listed in the Tools_ section.

You may also customize tools used at configuration time. Refer to section Tools_
for more informations.

You can now proceed to the |Build| phase.

.. _sect-user-build:

Build
-----

To build / compile / link programs, libraries, etc., run the :command:`make`
command like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make build

To store intermediate objects under an alternate location, give :command:`make`
the BUILDDIR_ variable like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make build BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

If not completed, the ``build`` target performs the configuration phase
implicitly using default configuration settings.

In addition, you may specify the PREFIX_ variable to change the default final
install location:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make build BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project PREFIX=/
   
You may refine the build logic by giving :command:`make` additional variables.
*You are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific needs*. Section
Reference_ describes the following variables which are available for build
customization purpose:

* EBUILDDIR_, |DEFCONFIG|, KCONF_,
* BUILDDIR_,
* PREFIX_, SYSCONFDIR_, BINDIR_, SBINDIR_, LIBDIR_, LIBEXECDIR_, LOCALSTATEDIR_,
  RUNSTATEDIR_, INCLUDEDIR_, PKGCONFIGDIR_, DATADIR_, DOCDIR_, INFODIR_,
  MANDIR_,
* CROSS_COMPILE_, AR_, CC_, LD_, PKG_CONFIG_,
* in addition to variables listed in the Tools_ section.

You may also customize tools used at build time. Refer to section Tools_ for
more informations.

You can now proceed to the |Install| phase.

.. _sect-user-install:

Install
-------

To install programs, libraries, etc., run the :command:`make` command like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make install
   
To store intermediate objects under an alternate location, give :command:`make`
the BUILDDIR_ variable like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make install BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

If not completed, the :ref:`install <target-install>` target performs the
|Build| phase implicitly.  Files are installed under directory pointed to by the
PREFIX_ :command:`make` variable which defaults to :file:`/usr/local`.

You may specify the PREFIX_ variable to change the default final install
location:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make install BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project PREFIX=/

You may refine the install logic by giving :command:`make` additional variables.
You are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific needs. Section
Reference_ describes the following variables which are available for install
customization purpose:

* EBUILDDIR_, |DEFCONFIG|, KCONF_,
* BUILDDIR_,
* PREFIX_, SYSCONFDIR_, BINDIR_, SBINDIR_, LIBDIR_, LIBEXECDIR_, LOCALSTATEDIR_,
  RUNSTATEDIR_, INCLUDEDIR_, PKGCONFIGDIR_, DATADIR_, DOCDIR_, INFODIR_,
  MANDIR_,
* CROSS_COMPILE_, STRIP_,
* in addition to variables listed in the Tools_ section.

You may also customize tools used at install time. Refer to section Tools_ for
more informations.

.. _sect-user-staged-install:

Staged install
--------------

DESTDIR_ :command:`make` variable allows support for staged install, i.e. an
install workflow where files are deployed under an alternate top-level root
directory instead of the usual directory pointed to by PREFIX_.

Basically, the DESTDIR_ variable is prepended to each installed target file so
that an install recipe might look something like:

.. code-block:: make

   install:
        $(INSTALL) foo $(DESTDIR)$(BINDIR)/foo
        $(INSTALL) libfoo.a $(DESTDIR)$(LIBDIR)/libfoo.a

The DESTDIR_ variable should be specified by the user on the :command:`make`
command line as an absolute file name. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make install DESTDIR=$HOME/staging

If usual installation step would normally install :file:`$(BINDIR)/foo` and
:file:`$(LIBDIR)/libfoo.a`, then an installation invoked as in the example above
would install :file:`$(HOME)/staging/$(BINDIR)/foo` and
:file:`$(HOME)/staging/$(LIBDIR)/libfoo.a` instead.

Prepending the variable DESTDIR_ to each target in this way provides for staged
installs, where the installed files are not placed directly into their expected
location but are instead copied into a temporary location (DESTDIR). However,
installed files maintain their relative directory structure and any embedded
file names will not be modified.

DESTDIR_ support is commonly used in package creation. It is also helpful to
users who want to understand what a given package will install where, and to
allow users who don’t normally have permissions to install into protected areas
to build and install before gaining those permissions.

Finally, it can be usefull when installing in a cross compile environment where
installation is performed according to a 2 stages process.
An initial stage installs files under a top-level root directory hierarchy
pointed to by the DESTDIR_ variable onto the development host. This step is
generally part of a larger process which constructs the whole final system image
to install onto the target host.
Then, the second stage carries out final system image installation onto the
target host thanks to a specific *installer* runtime that is out of scope of
this document.

Refer to |gnu_install_destdir| for more informations.

Cleanup
-------

3 additional :command:`make` targets are available to cleanup generated objects.

The :ref:`clean <target-clean>` target remove built objects from the BUILDDIR_
directory without cleaning up installed objects.
In other words, this performs the inverse operation of |Build| target:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make clean BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

The :ref:`distclean <target-distclean>` target runs
:ref:`clean <target-clean>` target then removes build configuration objects and
distribution_ tarball from the BUILDDIR_ directory.
In other words, this removes every intermediate objects, i.e., all generated
objects that have not been installed:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make distclean BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

The :ref:`uninstall <target-uninstall>` target removes
installed objects from the $(DESTDIR_)$(PREFIX_) directory.
In other words, this performs the inverse operation of |Install| target:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make uninstall PREFIX= DESTDIR=$HOME/staging

Documentation
-------------

When enabled internally by a project, |eBuild| may also generates project's
documentation thanks to (and restricted to) the |Sphinx| ecosystem.

Generation
**********

The :ref:`doc <target-doc>` :command:`make` target builds documentation under
:file:`$(BUILDDIR)/doc` directory :

.. code-block:: console

   $ make doc BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

In addition, objects generated by the :ref:`doc <target-doc>` target may be
removed using the :ref:`clean-doc <target-clean-doc>` or
:ref:`clean <target-clean>` target as described into section cleanup_.

You may refine the build logic by giving :command:`make` additional variables.
*You are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific needs*. Section
Reference_ describes the following variables which are available for
documentation generation customization purpose:

* BUILDDIR_,
* SPHINXBUILD_, PYTHON_, MAKEINFO_, LATEXMK_, DOXY_,
* in addition to variables listed in the Tools_ section.

Installation
************

To install documentation built thanks to :ref:`doc <target-doc>` target
under DOCDIR_ directory, use the :ref:`install-doc <target-install-doc>` target.

.. code-block:: console

   $ make install-doc BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

If not completed, the :ref:`install-doc <target-install-doc>` target builds the
documentation implicitly. Files are installed under directory pointed to by the
DOCDIR_ :command:`make` variable.

In addition, objects installed by the :ref:`install-doc <target-install-doc>`
target may be removed using the :ref:`uninstall-doc <target-uninstall-doc>` or
:ref:`uninstall <target-uninstall>` target as described into section cleanup_.

You may refine the documentation (un)install logic by giving :command:`make`
additional variables.  *You are encouraged to adjust values according to your
specific needs*. Section Reference_ describes the following variables which are
available for documentation generation customization purpose:

* PREFIX_,
* DATADIR_, DOCDIR_,
* MANDIR_, MANDB_,
* INSTALL_INFO_, INFODIR_.

In addition, when following a `Staged install`_ workflow, you may alter final
installation directory thanks to the DESTDIR_ variable so that final
documentation is deployed under $(DESTDIR_)$(DOCDIR_) filesystem hierarchy
instead.

.. _sect-user-tags:

Source tags
-----------

A :ref:`tags <target-tags>` :command:`make` target is also available to generate
source code tag databases using |Ctags| and / or |Cscope| tools.

When available, |Ctags| database is generated into the
:file:`$(BUILDDIR)/tags` file whereas |Cscope| database is generated into
:file:`$(BUILDDIR)/cscope.out` file.

.. code-block:: console

   $ make tags BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

In addition, objects generated by the :ref:`tags <target-tags>` target may be
removed using the :ref:`clean-tags <target-clean-tags>` or
:ref:`clean <target-clean>` target as described into section cleanup_.

You may refine the build logic by giving :command:`make` additional variables.
*You are encouraged to adjust values according to your specific needs*. Section
Reference_ describes the following variables which are available for source tags
generation customization purpose:

* BUILDDIR_,
* CTAGS_, CSCOPE_.
* in addition to variables listed in the Tools_ section.

Distribution
------------

A :ref:`dist <target-dist>` :command:`make` target is also available to generate
a source distribution tarball compressed according to the |XZ| format into
:file:`$(BUILDDIR)/<package_name>-<package_version>.tar.xz`.

Basically, the :ref:`dist target <target-dist>` generates, collects and include
the following components into the tarball :

* files required to build the project when no |eBuild| installation is found ;
* project's files found under revision control ;
* if any, the project's documentation files.

.. code-block:: console

   $ make dist BUILDDIR=$HOME/build/project

In addition, objects generated by the :ref:`dist <target-dist>` target may be
removed using the :ref:`distclean <target-distclean>` target as described into
section cleanup_.

.. _sect-user-tools:

Tools
-----

You may customize tools used during construction phases by giving
:command:`make` additional variables like so:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make build CROSS_COMPILE='armv7-linaro-linux-gnueabihf-'

Section Variables_ describes the following variables which are available for
tool customization purpose:

* AR_,
* CROSS_COMPILE_,
* CSCOPE_,
* CTAGS_,
* CC_,
* DOXY_,
* ECHOE_,
* GIT_,

Troubleshooting
===============

In case an error happens such as the one below:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make help
   Makefile:10: *** '/usr/share/ebuild': no valid Ebuild install found !.  Stop.
   
This means the project is not able to find the location where ebuild_ is
installed.  This *may* happen when working with a project source tree that has
been retrieved from version control system, i.e., not extracted from a source
distribution tarball.

Give :command:`make` an EBUILDDIR_ variable pointing to the top-level ebuild_
read-only data directory like so:

.. code-block:: console
   
   $ make help EBUILDDIR=/usr/local/share/ebuild
